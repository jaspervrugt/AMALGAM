# AMALGAM: Multi-criteria optimization using multimethod adaptive search

## Description

The evolutionary algorithm AMALGAM implements the novel concept of adaptive multimethod search to ensure a fast, reliable and computationally efficient solution to multiobjective optimization problems. The method finds a well-distributed set of Pareto solutions within a single optimization run, and achieves an excellent performance compared to commonly used methods such as SPEA2, NSGA-II and MOEA/D. In this paper, I review the basic elements of AMALGAM, provide a pseudo-code of the algorithm, and introduce a MATLAB toolbox which provides scientists and engineers with an arsenal of options and utilities to solve multiobjective optimization problems involving (among others) multimodality, high-dimensionality, bounded parameter spaces, dynamic simulation models, and distributed multi-core computation. The AMALGAM toolbox supports parallel computing to permit inference of CPU-intensive system models, and provides convergence diagnostics and graphical output. Four different case studies are used to illustrate the main capabilities and functionalities of the AMALGAM toolbox.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Download and unzip the zip file 'MATLAB_pcode_AMALGAM_V1.0.zip'.
* Add the toolbox to your MATLAB search path by running the script 'install_AMALGAM.m' available in 'MATLAB_pcode_MODELAVG_V1.0'
* You are ready to run the examples.

### Executing program

* After intalling, you can simply direct to each example folder and execute the local 'example_X.m' file.
* Please Make sure you read carefully the instructions (i.e., green comments) in 'install_AMALGAM.m' and the manual in PDF !!!
